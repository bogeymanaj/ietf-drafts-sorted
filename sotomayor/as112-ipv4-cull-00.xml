    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This is a direction to IANA concerning the delegation of certain
	additional IPv4 zones to the AS112 Project <xref 
	target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-as112-ops"></xref> which 
	operates in an <xref target="RFC4786">anycast cloud</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Reverse DNS Delegation, Local-Use and Test Addresses">
      <t>Work documenting <xref
        target="RFC5735">special use addresses</xref> have appeared containing
        good
	candidates for inclusion with the existing delegations to the AS112
	Project.  These local and special use addresses have now been
	captured and identified for Domain Name System (DNS <xref
	target="RFC1034"></xref> and <xref target="RFC1035"></xref>)
	zone administrators to curtail leaking
	queries in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-default-local-zones"></xref>.
      </t>

      <t>Additionally, <xref target="RFC5737"></xref> identifies a short
	listing of IPv4 address blocks for use in documentation.  These
	too should be considered for delegation to the AS112 Project.</t>

      <t>Thus the purpose of this memo is to effectively signal to the 
	AS112 Project <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-as112-ops"></xref> 
	that it should reflect the efforts of <xref 
	target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-default-local-zones"></xref> and follow
	directives and delegations subsequently issued as described in
	section 6.</t>

      <t>It is interesting to note that while the focus has largely been on
        the use of <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> addresses, some
        addresses (such as those first enumerated within <xref
        target="RFC1912"></xref>) have as of late also been the subject
	of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-default-local-zones"></xref>
	.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Impact of Lame DNS Reverse Delegations by Misconfigured AS112 Nodes">
      <t>Although not discussed previously in any related memo before, there
	exists the issue of AS112 nodes not being current with the
	published IANA registry or simply missing zones that they
	should be hosting on behalf of the global DNS system as part
	of their mandate to participate in the effort.</t>

      <t>Lame delegations occur when a DNS server has been identified
        to not only carry a delegated zone, but to also answer for it
        authoritatively, yet does neither.  The reasons for why this may
	happen may be varied (though most likely due to a misconfiguration
	within the DNS server itself), but the point is that lame delegations, 
	even in the reverse zones (such as arpa.) can and do create an
	impact ultimately to the end-user, along with DNS caches,
	applications, firewalls, etc.</t>

      <t>In the case of AS112 nodes and the zones they hold authority for, 
	if such a node were to be considered lame, then reverse queries to
	resolve addresses will result in delays created by timeouts.
	Additionally, these timeouts can be amplified as caching DNS servers
	no longer hold information about the addresses they may have once
	cached:  They naturally begin seeking to resolve an address
	by interrogating other DNS servers, ultimately leading to the
	the root and creating a further load - which is precisely what the 
	AS112 project seeks to prevent.</t>

      <t>For the end-user residing on a network that uses addresses which
	are delegated to a lame AS112 node, the usual result manifests 
	itself in the perception that either the local network is not
	functioning as usually expected or that the Internet is in some way
	down.</t>

      <t>This in turn may lead to an apparent denial of access to services
	for the end-user.  A domino effect can then be triggered from there,
	in which case the end-user may believe that a service is unavailable
	simply because a service administrator is unknowingly depending on
	a far-off AS112's node to be functioning properly.  It would not
	be long before support personnel would become involved, further
	committing more resources at the perceived problem.</t>

      <t>Finally, the impact to the AS112 Project itself should not be
	ignored.  If too many AS112 nodes are discovered to be lame servers,
	then it would naturally be in the best interests of the Internet
	community to remove affected delegations of reverse zones assigned
	to it as a whole.  This in turn lessens the effectiveness of the
	project and only serves to increase the traffic load to the root
	servers.  On top that, the reputation of the AS112 Project's as 
	providing a service for the common good of the community would be
	damaged because it would be deemed as unreliable.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>As per the provisions of <xref target="RFC3596"></xref>, this
	document recommends the IAB to direct IANA to delegate the following
	IN-ADDR.ARPA reverse DNS zones to the AS112 project <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-as112-ops"></xref>:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
              0.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 "This" Network)
            127.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Loop-Back Network)
        2.0.192.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Test Net 1)
     100.51.198.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Test Net 2)
      113.0.203.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Test Net 3)
255.255.255.255.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Broadcast)
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>AS112 project servers should add these zones to their configuration,
      and terminate queries efficiently inside their service
      infrastructure.</t>

      <t>This delegation instruction is subject to further direction in the
      future from the IAB to IANA, as per the provisions of <xref
      target="RFC3596"></xref>.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The Security Considerations described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-as112-ops"></xref> also apply to local-use IPv4
      addresses, and should be considered in the context of the use of these
      addresses.</t>

      <t>Security administrators as well as general support personnel who
      are involved in the operations of networked devices may also find
      the information found in the companion document <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-as112-under-attack-help-help"></xref> quite
      helpful.</t>

      <t>DNS queries may well identify the location of deployment of IPv4
      enabled equipment in private contexts, particularly when the reverse
      queries relate to local-use IPv4 addresses. While operators of the DNS
      reverse servers should respect the privacy of data relating to
      individual queries made to these reverse address servers, the
      unintentional leakage of information beyond its intended scope of use
      and circulation represents a potential threat to the security of a local
      private network. This direction to delegate these local-use IPv4 reverse
      address sub-domains does not substantially change the security risks of
      information leakage from private environments.</t>
