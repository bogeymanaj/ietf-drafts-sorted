    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the terminology for benchmarking link-state
      Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) route convergence. The terminology is to
      be used for benchmarking IGP convergence time through externally
      observable (black box) data plane measurements. The terminology can be
      applied to any link-state IGP, such as Intermediate System to
      Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).</t>

      this document is to introduce new terms required to complete execution
      of the Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence methodology <xref
      target="Po11m"></xref>.</t>

      <t>IGP convergence time is measured by observing the dataplane through
      the Device Under Test (DUT) at the Tester. The methodology and
      terminology to be used for benchmarking IGP Convergence can be applied
      to IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and link-state IGPs such as Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS) <xref target="Ca90"></xref><xref

          <t>Definition:</t>

          <t>The process of updating all components of the router, including
          the Routing Information Base (RIB) and Forwarding Information Base
          (FIB), along with software and hardware tables, with the most recent
          route change(s) such that forwarding for a route entry is successful
          on the Next-Best Egress Interface [<xref
          target="next-best_egress_interface"></xref>].</t>

          <t>Discussion:</t>

          <t>In general IGP convergence does not necessarily result in a
          change in forwarding. But the test cases in <xref
          target="Po11m"></xref> are specified such that the IGP convergence
          results in a change of egress interface for the measurement
          dataplane traffic. Due to this property of the test case
          specifications, Route Convergence can be observed externally by the
          rerouting of the measurement dataplane traffic to the Next-best
          Egress Interface [<xref

          (See <xref target="Th00"></xref>, Section 3) the Offered Load SHOULD
          consist of multiple Streams <xref target="Po06"></xref> and each
          Stream SHOULD consist of a single flow . If sending multiple
          Streams, the measured traffic statistics for all Streams MUST be
          added together.</t>

          <t>The destination addresses for the Offered Load MUST be
          distributed such that all routes or a statistically representative
          subset of all routes are matched and each of these routes is offered
          an equal share of the Offered Load. It is RECOMMENDED to send
          traffic to all routes, but a statistically representative subset of
          all routes can be used if required.</t>

          <t>At least one packet per route for all routes matched in the
          Offered Load MUST be offered to the DUT within each Packet Sampling
          Interval. For maximum accuracy the value for the Packet Sampling
          Interval SHOULD be as small as possible, but the presence of IP
          Packet Delay Variation (IPDV) <xref target="De02"></xref> may
          enforce using a larger Packet Sampling Interval.</t>

          <t>The Offered Load, IPDV, the number of routes, and the Packet
          Sampling Interval influence the observations for the Rate-Derived
          Method. It may be difficult to identify the different convergence
          time instants in the Rate-Derived Convergence Graph. For example, it
          is possible that a Convergence Event causes the Forwarding Rate to
          drop to zero, while this may not be observed in the Forwarding Rate
          measurements if the Packet Sampling Interval is too large.</t>

          <t>IPDV causes fluctuations in the number of received packets during
          each Packet Sampling Interval. To account for the presence of IPDV
          in determining if a convergence instant has been reached, Forwarding
          Delay SHOULD be observed during each Packet Sampling Interval. The
          minimum and maximum number of packets expected in a Packet Sampling
          Interval in presence of IPDV can be calculated with Equation 1.</t>

          <t>To determine if a convergence instant has been reached the number
          of packets received in a Packet Sampling Interval is compared with
          the range of expected number of packets calculated in Equation
          1.</t>

          <t>If packets are going over multiple ECMP members and one or more
          of the members has failed then the number of received packets during
          each Packet Sampling Interval may vary, even excluding presence of
          IPDV. To prevent fluctuation of the number of received packets
          during each Packet Sampling Interval for this reason, the Packet
          Sampling Interval duration SHOULD be a whole multiple of the time
          between two consecutive packets sent to the same destination.</t>

          <t>Metrics measured at the Packet Sampling Interval MUST include
          Forwarding Rate and Impaired Packet count.</t>

          <t>Loss-Derived Method SHOULD always be combined with Rate-Derived
          Method in order to observe Full Convergence completion. The total
          amount of Convergence Packet Loss is collected after Full

          <t>To measure convergence time and loss of connectivity benchmarks
          for Convergence Events that cause instantaneous traffic loss for all
          routes at the Convergence Event Instant, the Tester SHOULD observe
          Impaired Packet count on all DUT egress interfaces (see Connectivity
          Packet Loss [<xref target="connectivity_packet_loss"></xref>]).</t>

          <t>To measure convergence time benchmarks for Convergence Events
          that do not cause instantaneous traffic loss for all routes at the

          <t>Since Loss-Derived Method does not distinguish between traffic
          destinations and the Impaired Packet statistics are only collected
          after Full Convergence completion, this method can only be used to

          <t>Discussion:</t>

          <t>To benchmark Route-Specific Convergence Time, the Tester provides
          an Offered Load that consists of multiple Streams <xref

          representative subset of all routes. Each Stream SHOULD consist of a
          single flow (See <xref target="Th00"></xref>, Section 3).
          Convergence Packet Loss is measured for each Stream separately.</t>

          <t>Route-Specific Loss-Derived Method SHOULD always be combined with

          <t>Route-Specific Loss-Derived Method is the RECOMMENDED method to
          measure convergence time benchmarks.</t>

          <t>To measure convergence time and loss of connectivity benchmarks
          for Convergence Events that cause instantaneous traffic loss for all
          routes at the Convergence Event Instant, the Tester SHOULD observe
          Impaired Packet count on all DUT egress interfaces (see Connectivity
          Packet Loss [<xref target="connectivity_packet_loss"></xref>]).</t>

          <t>To measure convergence time benchmarks for Convergence Events

          <t>Since Route-Specific Loss-Derived Method uses traffic streams to

          <t>In general the Route Loss of Connectivity Period is not equal to

          <t>The Route Loss of Connectivity Period may be equal to the

          equal to the Loss-Derived Convergence Time. If the DUT continues to
          forward traffic to the Preferred Egress Interface after the
          Convergence Event is applied then the Loss-Derived Loss of
          Connectivity Period will be smaller than the Loss-Derived
          Convergence Time. This is also specifically the case after reversing
          a failure event.</t>

          <t>The Loss-Derived Loss of Connectivity Period may be equal to the
          Loss-Derived Convergence Time if, as a characteristic of the
          Convergence Event, traffic for all routes starts dropping
          instantaneously on the Convergence Event Instant. See discussion in
          <xref target="Po11m"></xref>.</t>

          <t>For the test cases described in <xref target="Po11m"></xref> each
          route's Route Loss of Connectivity Period is expected to be a single
          Loss Period <xref target="Ko02"></xref>.</t>

          <t>When benchmarking Loss-Derived Loss of Connectivity Period,
          Connectivity Packet Loss is measured for all routes and Equation 9
          is applied. The calculation is equal to Equation 6 in <xref
          target="loss_derived_convergence_time"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Definition:</t>

          <t>The interval at which the Tester (test equipment) polls to make
          measurements for arriving packets.</t>

          <t>Discussion:</t>

          <t>At least one packet per route for all routes matched in the
          Offered Load MUST be offered to the DUT within the Packet Sampling
          Interval. Metrics measured at the Packet Sampling Interval MUST
          include Forwarding Rate and received packets.</t>

          <t>Packet Sampling Interval can influence the convergence graph as
          observed with the Rate-Derived Method. This is particularly true
          when implementations complete Full Convergence in less time than the
          Packet Sampling Interval. The Convergence Event Instant and First
          Route Convergence Instant may not be easily identifiable and the
          Rate-Derived Method may produce a larger than actual convergence
          time.</t>

          <t>Using a small Packet Sampling Interval in the presence of IPDV
          <xref target="De02"></xref> may cause fluctuations of the Forwarding
          Rate observation and can prevent correct observation of the
          different convergence time instants.</t>

          <t>The value of the Packet Sampling Interval only contributes to the
          measurement accuracy of the Rate-Derived Method. For maximum
          accuracy the value for the Packet Sampling Interval SHOULD be as
          small as possible, but the presence of IPDV may enforce using a
          larger Packet Sampling Interval.</t>

          observed.</t>

          <t>Discussion:</t>

          <t>The purpose of the Sustained Convergence Validation Time is to
          produce convergence benchmarks protected against fluctuation in
          Forwarding Rate after the completion of Full Convergence is
          observed. The RECOMMENDED Sustained Convergence Validation Time to
          be used is the time to send 5 consecutive packets to each
          destination with a minimum of 5 seconds. The Benchmarking
          Methodology Working Group (BMWG) selected 5 seconds based upon <xref
          target="Br99"></xref> which recommends waiting 2 seconds for
          residual frames to arrive (this is the Forwarding Delay Threshold
          for the last packet sent) and 5 seconds for DUT restabilization.</t>

          <t>Discussion:</t>

          <t>Applying a Forwarding Delay Threshold allows to consider packets
          with a too large Forwarding Delay as being lost, as is required for
          some applications (e.g. voice, video, etc.). The Forwarding Delay

            <t>This RFC specifies an integrated routing protocol, based on the
            OSI Intra-Domain IS-IS Routing Protocol, which may be used as an
            interior gateway protocol (IGP) to support TCP/IP as well as OSI.
            This allows a single routing protocol to be used to support pure
            IP environments, pure OSI environments, and dual environments.
            This specification was developed by the IS-IS working group of the
            Internet Engineering Task Force.</t>

            <t>The OSI IS-IS protocol has reached a mature state, and is ready
            for implementation and operational use. The most recent version of
            the OSI IS-IS protocol is contained in ISO DP 10589. The proposed
            standard for using IS-IS for support of TCP/IP will therefore make
            use of this version (with a minor bug correction, as discussed in
            Annex B). We expect that future versions of this proposed standard
            will upgrade to the final International Standard version of IS-IS
            when available.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This memo documents version 2 of the OSPF protocol. OSPF is a
            link-state routing protocol. It is designed to be run internal to
            a single Autonomous System. Each OSPF router maintains an
            identical database describing the Autonomous System's topology.
            From this database, a routing table is calculated by constructing
            a shortest- path tree.</t>

            <t>OSPF recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological
            changes, utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic. OSPF
            provides support for equal-cost multipath. An area routing
            capability is provided, enabling an additional level of routing
            protection and a reduction in routing protocol traffic. In
            addition, all OSPF routing protocol exchanges are
            authenticated.</t>

            <t>The differences between this memo and RFC 2178 are explained in
            Appendix G. All differences are backward-compatible in nature.
            Implementations of this memo and of RFCs 2178, 1583, and 1247 will
            interoperate.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document describes the modifications to OSPF to support
            version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6). The fundamental
            mechanisms of OSPF (flooding, Designated Router (DR) election,
            area support, Short Path First (SPF) calculations, etc.) remain
            unchanged. However, some changes have been necessary, either due
            to changes in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6, or simply
            to handle the increased address size of IPv6. These modifications
            will necessitate incrementing the protocol version from version 2
            to version 3. OSPF for IPv6 is also referred to as OSPF version 3
            (OSPFv3).&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; Changes between OSPF for IPv4, OSPF
            Version 2, and OSPF for IPv6 as described herein include the
            following. Addressing semantics have been removed from OSPF
            packets and the basic Link State Advertisements (LSAs). New LSAs
            have been created to carry IPv6 addresses and prefixes. OSPF now
            runs on a per-link basis rather than on a per-IP-subnet basis.
            Flooding scope for LSAs has been generalized. Authentication has
            been removed from the OSPF protocol and instead relies on IPv6's
            Authentication Header and Encapsulating Security Payload
            (ESP).&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; Even with larger IPv6 addresses, most
            packets in OSPF for IPv6 are almost as compact as those in OSPF
            for IPv4. Most fields and packet- size limitations present in OSPF
            for IPv4 have been relaxed. In addition, option handling has been
            made more flexible.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; All of OSPF for IPv4's
            optional capabilities, including demand circuit support and
            Not-So-Stubby Areas (NSSAs), are also supported in OSPF for IPv6.

            <t>This document specifies a method for exchanging IPv6 routing
            information using the IS-IS routing protocol. The described method
            utilizes two new TLVs: a reachability TLV and an interface address
            TLV to distribute the necessary IPv6 information throughout a
            routing domain. Using this method, one can route IPv6 along with
            IPv4 and OSI using a single intra-domain routing protocol.
