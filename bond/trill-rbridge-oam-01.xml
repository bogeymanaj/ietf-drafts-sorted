    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILL protocol, a solution for transparent shortest-path frame routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-state routing protocol technology and encapsulation with a hop-count (<xref target="I-D.ietf-trill-rbridge-protocol">RFCtrill</xref>).  As RBridges are deployed, operators will face problems that require tools for troubleshooting of connectivity issues in the network. TRILL uses IS-IS for the control plane. IS-IS has a link-state database which contains the information of all links in the TRILL domain and IS-IS has a routing table. This information can be used for trouble shooting purposes. Simply being able to view the link-state database and routing table is insufficient for the requirements of operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM).
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition, RBridges should support SNMP, as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-trill-rbridge-protocol">RFCtrill</xref> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-trill-rbridge-mib">RBridgeMIB</xref>. SNMP, the routing table, and the link-state database are insufficient as the only OAM tools because while the control plane within an RBridge campus may be functioning successfully the data plane may not be. This motivates the need for OAM tools that allow an operator to test the data plane. Protocols such as IP, MPLS, and IEEE 802.1 have features enabling an operator to exercise the data plane (<xref target="RFC4443">RFC 4443</xref>, <xref target="RFC0792">RFC 0792</xref>, <xref target="IEEE.802-1ag">IEEE 802.1ag</xref>). There is a need for a similar set of tools in TRILL.
      </t>
      <t>
        Likewise, there is a need for error reporting capabilities inside an RBridge campus. For instance, if a TRILL Inner.VLAN tag has an illegal value there should be a way for devices to report this error. This would allow administrators of an RBridge campus to quickly locate a problem device in the network. This document specifies a set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and maintenance purposes in RBridge campuses along with a frame format. The features specified in this document include tools for traceroute, ping, and error reporting. <xref target="trill_oam_message"/> of this document specifies the general usage of a defined message format. <xref target="tools"/> specifies some additional applications of the message format. <xref target="trill_oam_message_format"/> specifies the format of the messages on the wire.

      <t>
        To facilitate message passing as needed by the OAM requirements, the TRILL OAM Channel (<xref target="I-D.eastlake-trill-rbridge-channel"/>) is utilized. The TRILL Header extended flag MAY be set if so desired.
      </t>

      <t>
        There are two types of TRILL OAM messages defined in this document carried within the TRILL OAM Channel: application and error notification. Frames with an error notification MUST NOT be generated in response to frames with an error notification.  Implementations SHOULD rate limit the origination of error notifications. Whereas unknown unicast frames are sent as multi-destination messages, sending unknown unicast frames with an error can lead to an amplification attack. As such special care and rate limiting are necessary for error notifications.
      </t>

      <t>
        The specification of rate limiting is beyond the scope of this document.  An RBridge SHOULD maintain counters for each type of error generated.
      </t>

      <t>
        Error notification messages contain the error-causing frame or the initial part thereof after its OAM message. The following are two figures showing application and error notification message structure. <xref target="trill_oam_message_format"/> goes into the details of these formats.

        Frames with the TRILL OAM message generated in response to another TRILL data frame MUST have fields set as follows unless otherwise specified:
      </t>

        <c>Application or Error</c>
        <c>Inner.MacSA</c>
        <c>If the Inner.MacDA of the received frame is one of the MAC addresses of the RBridge generating the frame, the value MUST be that MAC address. Otherwise, it MUST be one of the RBridge's MAC addresses.</c>

        <c>Application or Error</c>
        <c>Inner.MacDA</c>
        <c>
          The value SHOULD be All-OAM-RBridges . The Inner.MacDA MAY be other values as specified in subsequent sections.
        </c>

        <c>Application or Error</c>
        <c>Inner.VLAN ID</c>
        <c>The value MUST be one of the VLANs the egress RBridge advertises connectivity on. If the frame is generated in response to another frame it MUST be copied from the received frame.</c>

        <c>Application or Error</c>
        <c>Ingress RBridge nickname</c>
        <c>If the egress RBridge nickname of the received frame is a nickname of the RBridge generating the frame, then the value MUST be that nickname. Otherwise, it MUST be one of the RBridge's nicknames.</c>

        <c>Application or Error</c>
        <c>Egress RBridge nickname</c>
        <c>The value MUST be the ingress RBridge nickname of the received frame. If the ingress RBridge nickname received is unknown or reserved the frame MUST be generated on the port the frame was received on with an Outer.MacDA and egress RBridge nickname of the RBridge that transmitted the invalid frame.</c>

        <c>Error</c>
        <c>Offending Encapsulated Frame</c>
        <c>The value MUST be N bytes of the frame which had the error where N is the minimum of the frame size and the number of bytes that would bring the resulting error frame up to 1470 bytes. This MUST include the TRILL header and MUST NOT include the link-layer header.</c>

        <c>Error</c>
        <c>M Bit</c>
        <c>The value MUST be zero.</c>

        <c>Application or Error</c>
        <c>Inner.Priority</c>
        <c>The value SHOULD be one less than the priority of the received frame, but not less than the lowest priority. Defaults to zero for sent frames.</c>
      </texttable>
      <t>
        RBridge campuses do not, in general, guarantee lossless transport of frames so a frame containing a TRILL OAM Message, possibly generated in response to some other frame, might be lost.

    <section anchor="tools" title="RBridge Tools">
      <t>
        This section specifies a number of RBridge OAM tools. For classification purposes they are divided into two sections, applications and error tools.
      </t>
      <section anchor="app" title="Application RBridge Tools">
        <!-- ================================================================= -->
        <section anchor="hop_count_traceroute" title="Hop Count Traceroute">
          <t>
            The ability to trace the path the data takes through the network is an invaluable debugging tool. RBridge traceroute provides this functionality through use of the TRILL OAM message (See <xref target="trill_oam_message"/>). In a hop-count traceroute, the originating RBridge starts by transmitting one TRILL data frame with a TRILL OAM message. This message contains a protocol code of an echo request. (See <xref target="echo_request"/>) The ingress RBridge MUST be the RBridge originating the frame.
          </t>
          <t>
            When a traceroute is initiated, it is either targeting a known unicast target or a multi-destination target as specified by the operator. If the hop-count traceroute is for a known unicast target, the egress RBridge is the destination RBridge to which connectivity will be checked and the M bit MUST be zero. Otherwise, if the hop-count traceroute is for a multi-destination target, the egress RBridge is the distribution tree nickname for the traceroute. Multi-destination targets are handled the same as known unicast targets but require a small amount of additional logic as specified in <xref target="hop_count_traceroute_multi_dest_targets"/>.
          </t>
          <t>The first echo request frame transmitted MUST have a hop-count of one. The RBridge will continue transmitting these echo requests, incrementing the hop-count by one each time until a hop-count error notification is received from the destination. Each of these requests in turn will generate a hop-count error notification until the egress RBridge is reached. If a transit RBridge decrements the hop-count by more than one it may transmit multiple hop-count error notifications.</t>
          <t>
            The purpose of the traceroute is to confirm connectivity of the data plane, and therefore options such as a flow ID or a security option MAY be included. If an RBridge supports equal-cost multi-pathing (ECMP) or load balancing, the RBridge SHOULD allow operators to specify which flow the traceroute is assigned to. There is no need for all RBridges to use the same assignment method. Being able to specify the flow allows operators to test the path taken by data through the data plane. The purpose of the frame is to mimic a data frame that follows the same path through the data plane that a 'real' data frame would.
          </t>
          <t>
            The echo request MAY have an arbitrary 32-bit unsigned integer sequence number to assist in matching reply messages to the request. This is important for the hop-count traceroute since replies may return to the ingress RBridge in a different order then their matching requests were sent.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Inner.VLAN, Inner.MacSA, and Inner.MacDA SHOULD default to the values specified in <xref target="frame_field_values"  />.  RBridges SHOULD provide an option to change these values to assign the TRILL data frame to a flow.
          </t>
          <t>
            The replying RBridge MUST include its 16-bit port ID from the port on which the hop-count error generating frame was received in the incoming port field of the reply. It MUST also include its 16-bit port ID from the port on which the frame would be forwarded if the frame did not have a hop-count error. A port ID of &CONSUMED_PORT_ID_VALUE; indicates the frame was consumed by the RBridge itself. Finally the reply MUST include the 16-bit nickname of the next hop RBridge the frame would have been sent to if there were no error. If the request is a multi-destination frame, this field MUST be set to the nickname of the RBridge the frame was received from. This is the previous hop RBridge. This is to facilitate knowledge of a more precise path through the campus as seen in <xref target="RFC5837">RFC 5837</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The advantage of this traceroute method is the transit RBridges do not have to do any special processing of the frames until a hop-count error is detected, a condition they are required to detect by the TRILL base protocol. The disadvantage is the request-orginating RBridge needs to transmit as many frames as there are hops between itself and the destination RBridge.
          </t>
          <t>
            The end stations are not involved in this process. RBridge traceroutes are from RBridge to RBridge. While the frames sent may emulate data sent from ESa to ESb, the end stations are not, in fact, involved.
          </t>

          <section anchor="hop_count_traceroute_multi_dest_targets" title="Multi-Destination Targets">
            <t>For multi-destination targets at each branch in the tree the tagged frame will be replicated causing each RBridge in the tree, possibly pruned by VLAN and/or multicast group, to send a response to the echo request. If all RBridges in the possibly pruned distribution tree support the echo request message, then the ingressing RBridge will receive an echo reply from each of them. This is in contrast to a known unicast tagged frame where only the RBridges along the path from ingress to egress transmit the error notification. The ingressing RBridge can compile all of these replies, using the parent pointers located in the nexthop nickname field, into an output of the tree the traffic traversed. In the case that a non-valid distribution tree nickname is specified the traceroute frames SHOULD still be generated. The traceroute application MUST report any errors received, such as an invalid distribution tree nickname, caused by the hop-count traceroute frames. RBridges receiving a multicast destination echo request MUST NOT transmit an echo reply if the multi-destination bit is set. Echo requests that are not used with the hop-count traceroute come from the ping tool, and pings are not valid to multi-destination traffic. In a hop-count traceroute devices will already be transmitting a hop-count error notification and so there is no reason to transmit a double set of replies. A multi-destination hop-count traceroute does not stop when an echo reply is received. It stops when the transmitted hopcount reaches 0x3F.</t>

              In this diagram RB0 transmits frame (1) destined to RB2. This frame contains the echo request message and a hop-count of 0. When RB1 receives this frame it drops it and transmits a hop-count-exceeded message, (2), to RB0. RB0 then transmits a frame, (3), with a hop-count of 1. RB1 decrements this hop-count by 1 to 0 and forwards it to RB2. RB2 drops frame (3) and transmits a hop-count-exceeded message, (4), to RB0. The traceroute is now complete.

        <section anchor="ping" title="RBridge Ping">
          <t>
            Ping is a tool for verifying RBridge connectivity. As with an RBridge traceroute, the ping-originating RBridge transmits one or more TRILL data frames with a TRILL OAM message.  This message contains the code of an echo request (See <xref target="echo_request"/>). The ingress RBridge MUST be the RBridge-originating frame.  The egress RBridge is the destination RBridge to which connectivity will be checked.  The M bit MUST be zero.
          </t>

          <t>
            As with RBridge traceroute, options such as a flow ID or a security option MAY be included.  If an RBridge supports equal-cost multi-pathing (ECMP) or load balancing, the RBridge SHOULD allow operators to specify which flow the ping is assigned to.  There is no need for all RBridges to use the same assignment method. This ping traffic, once again, will mimic real traffic through the network, like traceroute traffic as previously specified in <xref target="hop_count_traceroute"/>.
          </t>

          <t>The echo request MAY have an arbitrary 32-bit unsigned integer sequence number to assist in matching reply messages to the request. In most circumstances, a single echo request is needed to complete the ping but it might be desirable for a single RBridge to ping multiple egress RBridges, or trace differing flows simultaneously.  Assigning differing sequence numbers to each frame aids in matching which trace the reply belongs to.</t>

          <t>
            The Inner.VLAN, Inner.MacSA, and Inner.MacDA SHOULD default to the values specified in <xref target="frame_field_values"  />. RBridges SHOULD provide the ability to change these values as to assign the TRILL data frame to a flow.  The payload of the frame is arbitrary and MAY contain any value.  This value can have an influence on which flow the frame is assigned to.
          </t>

          <t>
            RBridges implementing ping MAY issue a reply in response to this request.  See <xref target="security"/> for reasons on some RBridges are allowed to choose not to respond to a request. If an RBridge chooses to respond to the request, the reply MUST consist of one TRILL data frame per request with an OAM message containing the protocol code of an echo reply.  The echo reply MUST have the same sequence number as the request being matched.
          </t>

          <t>
            For the echo reply the ingress RBridge field MUST be the reply-originating RBridge's nickname.  The egress RBridge MUST be the request-originating RBridge's nickname.  The Inner.VLAN, Inner.MacSA, and Inner.MacDA SHOULD default to the values specified in <xref target="frame_field_values"  />. The Outer.VLAN ID MUST be preserved. The M bit MUST be zero.
          </t>

          <t>The reply-originating RBridge MUST include its 16-bit port ID from the port on which the request was received in the incoming port field of the reply.  It MUST also include its 16-bit port ID from the port on which the frame is forwarded.  A port ID of &CONSUMED_PORT_ID_VALUE; indicates the frame was consumed by the RBridge itself. The nickname field in the generated frame MUST be set to all zeros on transmission and ignored on reception. </t>

          <t>
            The Internal Hop Count field of the reply MUST be set to zero. The ping functionality does not use the Internal Hop Count field of the reply. (See <xref target="echo_reply" />)
          </t>

          <t>
            The reply frame need not follow the same path though the campus.  The reply messages are not meant to test the data plane.
          </t>

          <t>End stations are not involved in this the ping process.  RBridge pings are from RBridge to RBridge.  While the frames sent may emulate data sent from ESa to ESb, the end stations are not, in fact, involved.</t>

          <t>The transmitting RBridge MUST wait for a reply frame until a time-out occurs.  At that time, the RBridge MUST assume the frame was lost, and this MUST be indicated to the operator.  The length of this time-out is not specified in this document.</t>

        <t>
          Errors can occur through the reception of TRILL data frames. For this purpose, the error notification format is specified. These are generated due to various events as specified subsequently. When a TRILL data frame is received with an error, an error notification frame MAY be generated. See <xref target="security"/> for reasons on some RBridges are allowed to choose not to respond to a request. The generated reply MUST contain the error notification. The sub-code MUST contain a code specifying the error encountered. The valid values are specified in <xref target="error_specifiers"/>. Two of these sub-codes contain TLVs with additional information. The error notification also contains a 3 bit error type field which describes the error.
        </t>

        <t>
          This frame has a TRILL header and it contains, as its payload, the frame received with the error. If the size of the received frame would cause the generated frame to exceed 1470 bytes, the payload MUST be truncated to the 1470 bytes. The payload MUST include the TRILL header of the received frame and MUST NOT include the link-layer header. The generated reply MUST contain the error notification message specific to the error.
        </t>

        <t>When the original ingress RBridge receives the error frame, at a minimum, the RBridge SHOULD update a counter specifying the number of error frames received for the causing error. The encapsulated frame MUST NOT be decapsulated and transmitted. The RBridge SHOULD also keep a set of counters for errors reported by other RBridges.</t>

        <t>The two sub-codes that contain TLVs with additional information are described below. All other sub-codes specified in this document do not contain TLVs.</t>

        <section anchor="hop_count_zero_error_spec" title="Hop Count Zero Error">
          <t>When a TRILL data frame is received with a hop-count of zero, an error notification frame MAY be generated. The generated reply MUST contain the hop-count zero error sub-code. If the received frame has the echo request message, the hop-count zero error notification MUST have a sequence number matching the echo request. Otherwise, the sequence number MUST be set to zero. The incoming port ID MUST be the port ID the received frame arrived on. The outgoing port ID MUST be the port ID of the port the received frame would have been forwarded onto if the hop-count was not zero. Finally, the error notification MUST include the 16-bit nickname of the next hop RBridge the frame would have been sent to. If the request is a multi-destination frame, this field MUST be set to all zeros on transmission and ignored on reception. If the RBridge transmitting the request is the egress RBridge, this field MUST be set to 0x0000.</t>

          <t>When a TRILL data frame is received with a payload that would exceed the MTU of the port the frame would otherwise be forwarded to, an error notification frame MAY be generated.

The incoming port ID MUST be the port ID the received frame arrived on. The outgoing port ID MUST be the port ID of the port the received frame would have been forwarded onto if the frame size was not too large. Finally, the error notification message MUST include the 16-bit nickname of the next hop RBridge the frame would have been sent to.

        <t>To facilitate future interoperable expansion of the data carried in OAM sub-messages some sub-messages use a TLV encoding. These TLV sections consist of a list of type, length, value encoded data where the type signals to the RBridge how to interpret the value, and the length tells the RBridge the length of the value in bytes. The type and length are both 8 bit fields. A length of zero indicates the value is a UTF-8 string with a NULL ('\0') terminating byte. Preceeding the list of TLVs is a 16 bit total length field which specifies the total length of all the length fields in octet units.</t>

        IANA is request to create a new subregistry within the TRILL Parameter registry for "TRILL OAM Message Error Sub-Message Error Specifiers". This subregistry that is initially populated as specified in <xref target="error_specifiers"/>.  Additional values are allocated by IETF Review <xref target="RFC5226" />.

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        The nature of the TRILL OAM Message lends itself to security concerns. By providing information about the topology of a network, attackers can gain greater knowledge of a network in order to exploit the network. Passive attacks such as reading frames with an OAM message could be used to gain such knowledge or active attacks where an attacker mimics an RBridge can be used to probe the network. Authentication, data integrity, protection against replay attacks, and confidentiality for TRILL OAM frames may be provided using a to-be-specified TRILL Security Option. Using such a security option would mitigate both the passive and active attacks.
      </t>
      <t>
        For instance, data origin authentication could be provided in the future using a security options in the TRILL Header by verifying a hash using shared keys or a mechanism like SEND with CGA. To prevent replay attacks rate limiting, sequence numbers as well as some nonce based mechanism could be provided. Confidentiality for TRILL OAM frames could be provided based on some future security option extension which encypts TRILL frames.
      </t>
      <t>
        In a network where one does not wish to configure a security option, the threat of attackers is still present. For this reason, generation of any TRILL OAM Message frames is optional and SHOULD be configurable by an operator on a per RBridge basis. An RBridge MAY have this configurable on a per port basis. For instance, an operator SHOULD be able to disable hop-count traceroute reply messages or error notification message generation per port.
      </t>
      <t>
        Another security threat is denial of service through use of OAM messages. For this reason, RBridges MUST rate limit the generation of OAM message frames. For multi-destination frames, the frames MAY be discarded silently to prevent any denial of service atacks in case of an errored packet such as an 'options not recognized' error notification.
