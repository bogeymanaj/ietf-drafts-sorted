    <abstract>
      <t>The Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3) LIST+ Extension allows a
      POP3 client to instruct a POP3 server to send additional information
      with the LIST command response. This will help save message round trips
      and bandwidth overhead, especially on mailboxes containing several
      messages. On public POP3 servers, serving thousands of mailboxes, and
      being polled frequently, LIST+ will help reduce server load.</t>

        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

        <t>In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
        only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
        interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.</t>

        <t>In this document, the term "client" refers to a host making use of
        the POP3 service, while the term "server" refers to a host which
        offers the POP3 service.</t>

        <t>In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
        server respectively.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
        <t>Although POP3 is intended as a download-and-delete protocol,
        clients can decide to leave messages on the server, resulting in
        mailboxes containing several messages. Observations on a public POP3
        server have shown several POP3 clients using the LIST command, and,
        immediately followed, the UIDL command to get the Message Number,
        Message Size and Unique-ID, of all messages of a mailbox, to see if
        new messages have arrived. On large mailboxes, holding hundreds or
        thousands of mails, this causes serious resource consumption on the
        server, and will prolong the duration a mailbox is hold in locked
        state. This situation is even stressed by the fact that POP3 clients
        will usually poll a mailbox for new messages periodically in short
        intervals.</t>

        <t>The LIST command has to scan through all messages of a mailbox to
        support the Message Number and the Message Size. The following UIDL
        command also has to scan through all messages of a mailbox to support
        the Message Number and the Unique-ID. The Message Number sent with the
        UIDL command, in this scenario, is already known to the client, and
        therefore, is a redundant information (as in example shown in <xref
        pageno="true" target="legacy_example"></xref>).</t>

        <t>Using the LIST+ Extension, a server has to scan through the mailbox
        only for a single time, and can send the Message Number, Message Size
        and Unique-ID in a more compact form to the client (as shown in <xref
        pageno="true" target="example_listplus_all_msgs"></xref>).</t>

        <t>The LIST+ Extension also offers the possibility to fetch other
        useful information with the LIST command quasi "on the fly", like the
        age of a message, or the number of days a message is unread. This may
        be helpful for clients to decide if a message has to be deleted
        automatically due to clients' message deleting policies. There is no
        need to read the mail headers to make this decision in this case.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="listcommand" title="The LIST Command">
      <t>This section updates the syntax of the LIST command as well as the
      definition of the scan listing, both as defined in Section 5 of <xref
      target="RFC1939"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Formal syntax: LIST [msg] [flaglist]</t>

      <t>The flaglist is a list of LIST+ Flags, separated by a single space. A
      LIST+ Flag always starts with "+" (it means "add the following
      information"), followed by the name of the flag. A flag name MUST start
      with a letter ("A-Z" or "a-z"). It is RECOMMENDED to keep flag names as
      short as possible.</t>

      <t>A server, supporting LIST+, has to decide whether the first argument
      of the LIST command (if any) is a message number or a LIST+ Flag. If an
      argument starts with "+", and its second character is a letter, this
      parameter is to be considered as a LIST+ flag.</t>

      <t>If the server receives a LIST+ flag which is not supported, the
      server MUST issue a "-ERR" response.</t>

      <t>After the server has accepted a flaglist, it sends an extended scan
      listing for each requested message back to the client. The extended scan
      listing consists of: <list style="symbols">
          <t>The message-number of the message, followed by a single space</t>

          <t>The exact size of the message in octets, followed by a single
          space</t>

          <t>The value(s) as requested by the flaglist, separated each by a
          single space, in the same order as given in the flaglist. A value
          MUST consist of only ASCII characters in the range of 33-126 (hex
          21-7E). Otherwise, it is RECOMMENDED to use BASE64 encoding
          according to <xref target="RFC4648"></xref>.</t>
        </list>See <xref target="ABNF"></xref> for a formal syntax using
      ABNF.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Initial Set of LIST+ Flags">
      <section title="The +UIDL Flag">
        <t>The +UIDL Flag requests to add the Unique-ID of a message to the
        extended scan listing. The Unique-ID for a message is the same value
        as it would be sent by the UIDL command for this message. See <xref
        target="RFC1939"></xref>, Section 7, "UIDL Command".</t>

        <t>Servers not supporting the UIDL command MUST NOT advertise the
        +UIDL Flag in the LIST+ capability list.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The +AGE Flag">
        <t>The +AGE Flag requests to add the age of a message to the extended
        scan listing. The age is expressed in units of whole days since the
        message was delivered into the mailbox.</t>

        <t>A message delivered yesterday (regardless of the time) has an age
        of one. A message delivered today has an age of zero. The value is
        presented as a decimal integer.</t>

        <t>Servers unable to determine the age of a message in this way MUST
        NOT advertise the +AGE Flag in the LIST+ capability list.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The +UNREAD Flag">
        <t>The +UNREAD Flag requests to add the number of whole days, since
        the message was read for last time, to the extended scan listing.</t>

        <t>A message read yesterday (regardless of the time) for last time has
        a value of one. A message read today has a value of zero. The value is
        presented as a decimal integer.</t>

        <t>Servers unable to determine the number of whole days, since a
        message was read for last time, MUST NOT advertise the +UNREAD Flag in
        the LIST+ capability list.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title=" Parameter and Response Length ">
      <t>The Parameter and Response Lengths, as defined in Section 4 of <xref
      target="RFC2449"></xref>, are not affected by the LIST+ Extension Flags
      as defined in this document.</t>

      <t>The already defined Parameter and Response Lengths are sufficient to
      hold complete LIST+ command and response lines as defined in this
      document, even if all possible flags are given together.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Future Extensions to LIST+">
      <t>The LIST+ Extension itself is expandable. New LIST+ flags may be
      defined by future documents. If such a document defines a LIST+ flag
      whose value contains characters outside the range as defined in <xref
      target="listcommand"></xref>, it MUST declare how to encode the value,
      so it fulfills the requirements of this document.</t>

      <t>Future documents defining new LIST+ flags MUST contain a statement
      whether the Parameter and Response Length, as defined in Section 4 of
      [RFC2449], are sufficient to hold lines with all possible flags/values,
      or not. If not, new values for parameter and response length MUST be
      defined.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The LIST+ Extension does not influence any security issues.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document requests that IANA maintain a new keyword "LIST+" in
      the "POP3 Capabilities" registry.</t>

      <t>This document requests that IANA maintain a new registry "POP3 LIST+
      Flags".</t>

      <t>This document requests that IANA maintain three new keywords,
      "+UIDL", "+AGE" and "+UNREAD", in the "POP3 LIST+ Flags" registry.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conclusions">
      <t>All mail program/server developers are encouraged to implement
      LIST+.</t>

      <t>All carriers of POP3 servers holding mailboxes of many, frequently
      polling clients are encouraged to support LIST+.</t>
