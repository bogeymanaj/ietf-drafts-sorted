    <abstract>
<t>An important Operation, Administration and Maintenance requirement of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to estimate the throughput (i.e. bandwidth) for an MPLS-TP connection which could be an MPLS-TP PW, LSP or Section. This document specifies OAM packets and protocol mechanisms to facilitate the efficient and precise measurement of throughput.</t>

  <section title="Introduction">

  <t>As defined in <xref target="RFC5860"/>, the MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide a function to enable conducting diagnostic tests on a PW, LSP or Section, this function SHOULD be performed on-demand and one example of such diagnostic test consists in estimating the bandwidth of e.g., an LSP.</t>

  <t>To make this requirement clearer and provide more details, this sub-function of diagnostic tests is specified as "throughput estimation" in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"/>, throughput estimation is an on-demand out-of-service function, that allows verifying the bandwidth/throughput of an MPLS-TP transport path (LSP or PW) before it is put in-service. Throughput estimation is performed between MEPs and can be performed in one-way or two-way mode.</t>

  <t>This document specifies the OAM packets and procedures for both one-way and two-way throughput estimation/measurement.</t>

  <section title="Overview">

  <t>In <xref target="RFC1242"/>, the throughput is specified as a performance metric for network interconnection device, and it's defined by "the maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are dropped by the device". In MPLS-TP context the concept of throughput is not just for a particular device, but extended to apply to an MPLS-TP connection which could be a PW, LSP or Section.</t>

  <t>In <xref target="RFC2544"/>, corresponding to <xref target="RFC1242"/>, the throughput measurement procedures are specified as "send a specific number of frames at a specific rate through the DUT and then count the frames that are transmitted by the DUT. If the count of offered frames is equal to the count of received frames, the fewer frames are received than were transmitted, the rate of the offered stream is reduced and the test is rerun. The throughput is the fastest rate at which the count of test frames transmitted by the DUT is equal to the number of test frames sent to it by the test equipment". But in current practical throughput measurement scenario, usually the throughput is measured by test equipment using the more efficient and precise binary search algorithm.</t>

  <t>It should also be noted that for different test packet size, or test packet pattern, or test packet PHB, or expected measurement resolution, or even sending duration of test traffic, different result of throughput measurement may be obtained, so all these parameters need to be configurable for throughput measurement.</t>

    <section title="Two-way Throughput Measurement">
    <t> For a bidirectional MPLS-TP connection, two-way throughput measurement needs to be supported. Two-way throughput should include both the throughput for the forward direction of the connection and the throughput for the reverse direction of the connection. In order to simplify the implementation and facilitate the results collection, all computational overhead and procedures control will be taken by the initiator MEP of throughput measurement, and the peer MEP will act just as a responder. Also note that both the initiator MEP and the peer MEP need to send test traffic for two-way throughput measurement.</t>
    <t> It is worth noting that there is another optional definition of two-way throughput estimation, in which only the initiator MEP needs to send test traffic and the peer MEP will loop back all received test packets. But note that in this case only the minimum of available throughput of the two directions can be achieved, so this optional definition of two-way throughput estimation is not recommended in this draft.</t>
    </section>
       
    <section title="One-way Throughput Measurement">
    <t> For a bidirectional MPLS-TP connection, one-way throughput measurement also needs to be supported. One-way throughput only indicates the throughput for the forward direction of the connection. Similar to two-way throughput measurement, the initiator MEP controls the whole process of one-way throughput measurement and the peer MEP will act just as a responder. Also note that only the initiator MEP needs to send test traffic for one-way throughput measurement.</t>
    </section>
       
    <section title="Unidirectional Connections">
    <t> For a unidirectional MPLS-TP connection (such as a unidirectional LSP), only one-way throughput measurement needs to be supported. If it's a unidirectional connection with return path, the procedures of one-way throughput measurement for bidirectional connection still apply. Else if it's a unidirectional connection without return path, the procedures of one-way throughput measurement are not as automatic as that for bidirectional connection, and manual provision of test parameters is needed for every run of sending test traffic. Besides, in this case the peer MEP instead of the initiator MEP will act as calculator for the packet loss of every run.</t>
    </section>
       
  </section>

  <section title="Packet Format">
  <t>For throughput measurement the specific packets sent by the MEP can be divided into indication packets and test packets. The throughput measurement indication packets flow over the Generic Associated Channel Channel (G-ACh) <xref target="RFC5586"/> of an MPLS-TP connection and perform signaling between the initiator MEP and the peer MEP, while the throughput measurement test packets compose the test traffic which intends to emulate the real user traffic.</t>

    <section title="Throughput Measurement Test Packet Format">
    <t>In order to simplify the implementation of MPLS-TP OAM functions, the format of a throughput measurement test packet should be aligned with the format of a data plane loopback test packet, which is specified in section 5 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb"/>. As indicated in section 3.1, four pattern types of throughput measurement test packets can be constructed based on Padding field and optional CRC-32 field.</t> 
    </section> 
  
  </section> 

  <section title="Throughput Measurement Procedures">
  <t>As specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"/>, before throughput measurement is initiated, the diagnosed MEG should be put into a Lock status, and an MEG can be put into a Lock status either via NMS action or using the Lock Instruct OAM tool which is specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb"/>. In addition, the test parameters for sending test traffic need to be provisioned at the initiator MEP before initiating a throughput measurement, and they include initial sending rate, sending duration for every run, test packet size, test packet Pattern, test packet PHB and also the expected measurement resolution. Also note that no any provision is needed at the peer MEP.</t>
	<section title="Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Start Request">
	<t>After initiating a throughput measurement operation, the initiator MEP will at first transmit a throughput measurement Start Request to the peer MEP. Also note that for every rerun of sending test traffic, the initiator MEP must transmit this message as beginning.</t> 
	<t>For one-way throughput measurement, this message is intended to inform the peer MEP about the start of test traffic sending and trigger the peer MEP to start counting test packets. Specifically if one-way throughput measurement is performed on a unidirectional MPLS-TP connection without return path, the initiator MEP also should start sending test traffic a while (such as 1 second) after transmitting the Start Request. For two-way throughput measurement, except for the same intention as one-way throughput measurement, this message is also intended to convey necessary test parameters to the peer MEP and trigger the test traffic sending at the peer MEP, and note that for rerun only Run Count and Sending Rate in the message need to be changed while other parameters retain initial values. Furthermore, for both one-way and two-way measurement, the initiator MEP should start counting test packets as soon as it transmits this message.</t>
	<t>Specifically if the connection is unidirectional, then the Control Code in the message must not be set to 0x0 (in-band reply requested), moreover if no return path exists the Control Code in the message must be set to 0x2 (no reply requested).</t> 	
	</section> 
	<section title="Receiving a Throughput Measurement Start Request">
	<t>Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Start Request, the peer MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field or value is found then the peer MEP should start counting test packets. In addition, if the received W-flag indicates that this is a two-way throughput measurement, then the peer MEP also should start sending test traffic.</t> 
	<t>Specifically if the received W-flag indicates that this is a one-way throughput measurement, and the received Control Code is set to 0x2 (no reply requested) which means the connection is unidirectional without return path, then the peer MEP won't transmit Start Reply.</t> 	
	</section> 
	<section title="Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Start Reply">
	<t>When the Control Code in a received Start Request is set to 0x0 (in-band reply requested) or 0x1 (out-of-band reply requested), the peer MEP must transmit a throughput measurement Start Reply to the initiator MEP. The Control Code in Start Reply Message should be set to 0x0 to reflect the successful operation at the peer MEP, or on the contrary set to 0x1 to reflect the failed operation at the peer MEP. Except the R-flag and Control Code field, other fields of Start Reply Message will be copied from the received Start Request Message.</t>

	<t>Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Start Reply, the initiator MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field or value is found, and the received Control Code indicates successful operation at the peer MEP, then the initiator MEP should start sending test traffic. If there is no any throughput measurement Start Reply received after a while (such as 1 second), then specific error should be returned at the initiator MEP and no test traffic will be sent from the initiator MEP.</t> 
	</section> 
	<section title="Sending and Receiving Test Traffic">
	<t>From above procedures it can be seen that for two-way throughput measurement the pair of MEPs will send test traffic asynchronously, and the peer MEP will start/stop sending test traffic some earlier than the initiator MEP, but the asynchronism has no side-effect on the measurement result because both MEPs shall start counting test packets before they receive any test traffic.</t> 
	<t>Also note that when the initiator MEP sends test traffic the test parameters are all derived from the provisioned test parameters for the first run, and for rerun only the sending rate is changed and derived from the local calculation. When the peer MEP sends test traffic, the test parameters are all derived from the received Start Request Message.</t> 
	</section>   
	<section title="Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Stop Request">
	<t>For every run, after the initiator MEP finished sending test traffic, it will transmit a throughput measurement Stop Request to the peer MEP. This message is intended to inform the peer MEP about the stop of test traffic sending, and also trigger the peer MEP to stop counting test packets and feed back the counters.</t> 
	<t>Specifically if the connection is unidirectional, then the Control Code in the message must not be set to 0x0 (in-band reply requested), moreover if no return path exists the Control Code in the message must be set to 0x2 (no reply requested).</t> 
	</section> 
	<section title="Receiving a Throughput Measurement Stop Request">
	<t>Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Stop Request, the peer MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field or value is found then the peer MEP should stop counting test packets.</t> 
	<t>Specifically if the received W-flag indicates that this is a one-way throughput measurement, and the received Control Code is set to 0x2 (no reply requested) which means the connection is unidirectional without return path, then the peer MEP won't transmit Stop Reply and it will use the received Tx Counter to calculate test packet loss directly.</t> 
	</section> 
	<section title="Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Stop Reply">
	<t>When the Control Code in a received Stop Request is set to 0x0 (in-band reply requested) or 0x1 (out-of-band reply requested), the peer MEP must transmit a throughput measurement Stop Reply to the initiator MEP. The Control Code in Stop Reply Message should be set to 0x0 to reflect the successful operation at the peer MEP, or on the contrary set to 0x1 to reflect the failed operation at the peer MEP. Furthermore, the Stop Reply is transmitted also to confirm that the peer MEP has stopped sending test traffic for this run. The Tx Counter and Rx Counter are set to the test packet counting values at the peer MEP. </t>

	<section title="Receiving a Throughput Measurement Stop Reply">
	<t>Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Stop Reply, the initiator MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field or value is found, and the received Control Code indicates successful operation at the peer MEP, then the initiator MEP should stop counting test packets and start calculating the test packet loss. Suppose the Tx Counter and Rx Counter for the initiator MEP are TxP1 and RxP1, and for the peer MEP are TxP2 and RxP2.</t> 
	<t>For two-way throughput measurement, the calculation formulas are as follow:</t> 
	<t>Packet Loss (forward) = TxP1 - RxP2</t> 
	<t>Packet Loss (reverse) = TxP2 - RxP1</t> 
	<t>For one-way throughput measurement, the calculation formula is as follow:</t> 
	<t>Packet Loss (one-way) = TxP1 - RxP2</t> 
	<t>If there is no any throughput measurement Stop Reply received after a while (such as 1 second), then specific error should be returned at the initiator MEP and no consequent action will happen.</t> 
	</section> 
	<section title="Consequent Actions and Searching Algorithm">
	<t>Procedures for one run of test traffic sending and test packet loss calculation have been described above in details, but usually iterative reruns of the procedures are needed for a throughput measurement. Whether the rerun is needed or not is based on the calculated test packet loss and whether the expected measurement resolution is met. For one-way throughput measurement, if calculated Packet Loss (one-way) is equal to zero and the expected measurement resolution is met, then rerun is not needed (i.e. the one-way throughput measurement finished) and the current sending rate is the measured one-way throughput, otherwise the one-way throughput measurement proceeds. For two-way throughput measurement, if calculated forward Packet Loss and reverse Packet Loss are both equal to zero and the expected measurement resolution for both forward and reverse directions is met, then rerun is not needed (i.e. the two-way throughput measurement finished) and the current sending rate for forward/reverse direction is the measured forward/reverse throughput, otherwise the two-way throughput measurement proceeds, and in this case the sending rates for rerun should be calculated for forward direction and reverse direction respectively.</t> 
	<t>The simple and efficient binary search algorithm is RECOMMENDED to calculate the sending rate for the next run, which is the only changed test parameter compared with this run. How the binary search works, if packet loss is found for this run, it searches downwards for a lower rate which is halfway rate between the rate of this run and the known highest rate at which no packet loss is found; if no packet loss is found but the expected measurement resolution is not met for this run, it searches upwards for a higher rate which is halfway rate between the rate of this run and the known lowest rate at which packet loss is found; the measurement searches among higher and lower rates on the analogy of this, until it finds the rate at which no test packet is lost and expected measurement resolution is met, and this rate is the measured throughput. How to judge whether the expected measurement resolution is met or not, if the rate difference between the two consecutive runs (i.e. this run and the previous run), expressed as a percentage, is smaller than or equal to the specified measurement resolution, it's known as that the expected measurement resolution is met, otherwise it's not met.</t> 
	<t>For example, suppose to measure the throughput of a connection whose actual throughput is 70Mbps, the provisioned initial sending rate is 100Mbps and the specified measurement resolution is 0.1. Note that the initial sending rate should be higher than the actual throughput, otherwise the binary search is not applicable, and so it's often set to the maximum theoretical throughput of the measured connection. For the first run, packet loss is found, so for the second run, the sending rate will be calculated as (100+0)/2 = 50Mbps, no packet loss is found, then the resolution will be calculated as (100-50)/50 = 1, which is bigger than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is not met, so for the third run, the sending rate will be calculated as (100+50)/2 = 75Mbps, packet loss is found, so for the fourth run, the sending rate will be calculated as (50+75)/2 = 62.5Mbps, no packet loss is found, then the resolution will be calculated as (75-62.5)/62.5 = 0.2, which is bigger than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is not met, so for the fifth run, the sending rate will be calculated as (75+62.5)/2 = 68.75Mbps, no packet loss is found, then the resolution will be calculated as (68.75-62.5)/68.75 = 0.09, which is smaller than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is met, so the measurement finished and the rate 68.75Mbps is the measured throughput.</t> 
	<t>Other algorithms than the binary search algorithm could also be used to search throughput in practice, e.g. increasing or decreasing the sending rate in a fixed step from a specified initial sending rate until the test packet loss appears or disappears.</t>

  <section title="Throughput Measurement Time"> 
  <t>The throughput measurement time is about the product of sending duration for one run and number of all run times. The sending duration for one run is provisioned before the throughput measurement starts, and the number of all run times is related to several factors, which include the provisioned initial sending rate, the applied searching algorithm and the specified expected measurement resolution. It's obvious that longer sending duration is provisioned, then longer throughput measurement time is needed, but it should be noted that longer sending duration can result in more precise measured throughput, so there should be a balance between them. Also obviously the expectations for shorter throughput measurement time and higher throughput measurement resolution are mutually exclusive, so the balance between them is needed too.</t>

  <section title="Open Issue"> 
  <t>Wouldn't it be better to have a threshold on the acceptable frame loss rate and not require absolutely no packet loss?</t>
  <t>[Editor's note: As the authors know in practice when the throughput is measured by test devices, one threshold on the acceptable frame loss rate is configurable, but in <xref target="RFC1242"/> and <xref target="RFC2544"/> the throughput is defined as that way no packet loss permitted.]</t>
